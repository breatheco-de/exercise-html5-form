# HTML5 Form
<!--endhide-->

Forms are boring, they are difficult to style, and we have to start dealing with the many user-related issues here (Like usability, security, validations, etc.).

On the other hand, forms are responsible Web 2.0, they enable interactive websites and all the fun!

In this project, you will learn to style forms like a Pro! Using bootstrap components, HTML5 elements, and your first small validations!

## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository.

1. The first step to start coding is cloning the [html boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello) on your local computer or opening it using gitpod.

a) If using Gitpod you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello). 

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: `$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello`.  

>ðŸ’¡ Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.


## Instructions

1. Please use your HTML5/CSS skills to replicate [this exact same form](https://github.com/breatheco-de/html5-form/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true).
2. It's recommended to use the bootstrap framework if you already know it. If you don't, then practice your layout skills using the flex box.

</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/breatheco-de/html5-form/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true">click to open image in a new window</a></p>

3. You have to make sure all inputs are being used properly: Input type date, email, input type number, etc.
4. You also have to make sure to prevent and validate the form in all ways that HTML5 allows you (required inputs, formats, etc.).
5. If you are `not` using bootstrap: build a layout strategy by drawing all the div boxes you can identify, focus particularly on the divs that are laid out horizontally in the same line because those will require using `display: flex`.
6. If you are using bootstrap: In order to practice all the classes that bootstrap gives you to style your forms, you need almost no CSS of your own.

## Resources

Only if you are using bootstrap: Here is the [bootstrap 5 documentation about forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/))

## Strategy

### If you are not using bootstrap

The layout for this exercise requires a lot of `<div>` and boxes, here is a proposal that could work.

### If you are using bootstrap

If you are using bootstrap look for the forms documentation and read the example layouts, don't just copy paste what you see, try understanding the HTML code behind the examples so you can tweak them into your solution.

## What to do if you are stuck?

Don't get frustrated, ask for help! After you try on you own for 30 minutes, it is time to stop trying and ask for help.
