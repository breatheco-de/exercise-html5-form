## üå± How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `html template repository` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command. 

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```text
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

**Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.


## üìù Instructions

1. Please use your HTML5/CSS and Bootstrap skills to replicate [this exact same form](https://github.com/breatheco-de/html5-form/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true).
2. It's recommended to use the Bootstrap framework if you already know it. If you don't, then practice your layout skills using flexbox.<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/breatheco-de/html5-form/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true" height="300" /></p><p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/breatheco-de/html5-form/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true">Click to open image in a new window</a></p>
3. You have to make sure all inputs are being used properly: Input type date, email, input type number, etc.
4. You also have to make sure to prevent and validate the form in all ways that HTML5 allows you (required inputs, formats, etc.).
5. Use the `<input type="date">`, don't try to code your own date picker calendar.
6. If you are *not* using Bootstrap: build a layout strategy by drawing all the `<div>` boxes you can identify, focus particularly on the divs that are laid out horizontally in the same line because those will require using `display: flex`.
7. If you are using Bootstrap: In order to practice all the classes that Bootstrap gives you to style your forms, you need almost no CSS of your own.

## üìí Resources

Only if you are using Bootstrap: Here is the [Bootstrap 5 documentation about forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/forms/overview/). Try understanding the HTML code behind the examples so you can tweak them into your solution.

## Strategy

### If you are not using Bootstrap

The layout for this exercise requires a lot of `<div>` and boxes, here is a proposal that could work.
